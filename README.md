# LocalTemp
Simple program that doesn't require backend at all that displays the weather and the current date, completely free as it sends the API request using from the client.

* Why?
I had to re-write teacher's code, but it's boring as hell, so I decided to make my own advanced version that show more details such as temp and is it cold or not.
